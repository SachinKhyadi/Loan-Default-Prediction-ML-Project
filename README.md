# Loan-Default-Prediction-ML-Project
This project builds a machine learning system to identify potential loan defaulters using borrower attributes, loan details, and credit-risk features. The model improves default detection, supports lending decisions, reduces financial risk, and streamlines the loan evaluation process.
